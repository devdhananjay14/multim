# Neural Networks for binary classification on multiple data modalities

 This project is meant to be an extensible PyTorch framework to experiment with various neural-networks-based deep learning algorithms on multiple data modalities.

## Main features

* **Dynamic multi-modal architectures**. The user is offered off-the-shelf and easy-to-combine basic architectures (e.g. CNN, GRU, etcâ€¦) for multimodal approaches to binary classification tasks;
* **Structured experiments**. possibility of running multiple reproducible iterations of CV using different random seeds or metadata and generating detailed reports (including metrics, plots and predictions);
* **Data management**. Ready-to-use grouped data split for K-fold and Leave One Out CV, generated anew or based on metadata;
Ease of extension. Clear extension points and easy customisation of the software for different use cases.

## Structure of the project

The project is structured around some main components stored in the following directories:

* `classifier`: code related to the core of the project, including the fundamental classes which handle the datasets and the training and evaluation of the models as well as the network architectures:
* `preprocessing`: code related to the data generation and preprocessing;
* `scripts`: utility scripts (e.g. post-processing of the results and analysis of the data splits);
* `dataset`: one or more datasets and the corresponding metadata and data split for the cross validation procedure.

The relationship and interaction among the the main packages is summarised by the following scheme.
